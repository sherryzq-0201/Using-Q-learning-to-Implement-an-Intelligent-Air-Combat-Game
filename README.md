This article introduces how to implement an intelligent plane battle game using the Q-learning algorithm.  Q-learning is a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal policy by continuously updating the Q-value table.  In the game, the agent balances exploration and exploitation through the ε-greedy strategy: with probability `epsilon`, it randomly selects an action for exploration;  otherwise, it chooses the action with the highest Q-value for the current state.  The state space includes the player's plane coordinates, the nearest enemy's coordinates, the number of enemies, and the number of bullets, with discretization used to reduce computational complexity.  The action space covers moving up, down, left, and right, as well as firing bullets.  The reward function is designed to encourage long-term survival and high scores.  During training, the agent updates the Q-value table using the Bellman equation: `Q(s,a) = (1-α)*Q(s,a) + α*(r + γ*max(Q(s',a')))`, where `α` is the learning rate and `γ` is the discount factor.  After training, the agent performs well in test mode, successfully learning strategies to shoot enemies and avoid collisions.  This article also visualizes the agent's performance improvement through training curves and proposes future directions for enhancement.

In the game design, the player controls a plane to move within the lower half of the screen, avoiding collisions with enemies while shooting them to earn points.  Enemies spawn randomly at the top of the screen and move vertically downward.  Collisions reduce the player's life, and the game ends when life reaches 0.  The state space includes the player's plane coordinates, the nearest enemy's coordinates, the number of enemies, and the number of bullets.  The action space includes moving up, down, left, and right, as well as firing bullets.  The reward function is designed as follows: +100 points for hitting an enemy, -1 life for colliding with an enemy, and +0.1 points for each frame survived.  Game settings include parameters such as plane speed, bullet speed, enemy health, as well as colors and initial life values.  Through the Q-learning algorithm, the agent learns strategies to shoot enemies and avoid collisions.  Training results are visualized through score, hit rate, and survival time curves, demonstrating the agent's performance improvement.
